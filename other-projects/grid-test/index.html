          Contrary to the expectations of his companions, Spike returns to the
          Bebop, but only to say goodbye to them permanently. Spike asks Jet to
          cook him food and then tells the story of his life as a fairy tale.
          They laugh together one last time, and then Jet lets him go to meet
          his fate. At the entrance of the hangar Spike comes across Faye who
          puts her gun to his head in an attempt to stop him. She reminds him of
          the time he told her to forget the past and live in the present.

          There are ends we don't desire, but they're inevitable, we have to
          face them. It's what being human is all about.

        <p class="card__quote card__quote--jet">
          Humans were meant to work and sweat to earn a living. Those that try
          to get rich quick, or live at the expense of others, all get divine
          retribution somewhere along the line. That's the lesson.
          Unfortunately, we quickly forget the lessons we've learned and then we
          have to learn them all over again.

          Faye was particularly influenced by her younger self on the videotape.
          She became more empathetic, caring, and vulnerable. She encouraged Ed
          to find where she belonged.

        <p class="card__quote">
          Once upon a time, in New York City in 1941... at this club open to all
          comers to play, night after night, at a club named "Minston's Play
          House" in Harlem, they play jazz sessions competing with each other.
          Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a
          new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed
          style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish
          then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are
          gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play freely without fear of
          risky things. They must create new dreams and films by breaking
          traditional styles. The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will
          be called... COWBOY BEBOP.
