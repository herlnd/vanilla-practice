    <h2>About The Dish</h2>
    <p>
      It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta,
      spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with
      vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum
      wheat semolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      An emblem of Italian cuisine, spaghetti is frequently served with tomato
      sauce, which may contain various herbs (especially oregano and basil),
      olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include
      amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as Pecorino Romano,
      Parmesan and Grana Padano, are often sprinkled on top.

    <h2>How to prepare it, step by step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook spaghetti: Fill a large Dutch oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full
        and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti. Separate pasta with
        tongs a few times during the first 2 minutes of cooking to ensure it
        does not stick. Keep cooking uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al
        dente, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain pasta: Test the spaghetti for doneness towards the end by grabbing
        one strand onto a plate with tongs. Do not overcook until too soft. The
        key to tasty pasta is cooked pasta with a bite. Drain in a colander.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook garlic: Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil, 4
        garlic cloves, and oregano. Cook for 20 seconds, stirring constantly.
        Garlic cooks fast and can easily burn, so don’t walk away. Turn off the
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, pepper, and 1
        more fresh garlic clove: Stir gently until warmed through. That 1 clove
        of fresh garlic at the end is a must!
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with parmesan…and serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>
