# The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a rock paper scissors game, done as a project for the TOP's JavaScript curriculum.

The first approach was to develop a console app that prompts the user for input and returns the results on the browser's console.

Later on, with some new knowledge about the DOM and how to manipulate it, the task was to implement a user interface.
